Introduction

<h2>
  Mashing up Web services is a popular approach to compose existing web services, in order to create value-added new services, improve the development efficiency, solve the problem of software reuse, etc.
    However, an increasing number of services are published on the Web and leads to the difficulty of choosing appropriate services for mashup creation.
    Currently, there are already some service recommendation techniques that have been developed for mashup creation, however, they are largely limited to suggesting services with similar functionality.
    To tackle this problem, we present a novel approach to recommend a bundle of complemenatry services to fulfil users' requirements.
    Compared with the semantics of a single service,
    the service group which is composed of different services processes richer and more extensive semantics.
    Therefore, we devise compositional semantics to present the deep semantic of service group.
    In this model, we leverage Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Discourse Parser to construct a compositional semantic knowledge base. Based on the constructed knowledge base,
    a bundle of complementary service groups are recommended to fulfil usersâ€™ requirements. We conduct careful experiments on the real-world dataset,
  	showing significant improvements in both precision and recall metrics over the state-of-the-art methods.
